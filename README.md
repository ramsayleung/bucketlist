#  BucketList

This project is supervisored by [100 Days of SwiftUI](https://www.hackingwithswift.com/100/swiftui/68) to build an app that lets the user build a private list of places on the map that they intend to visit one day, add a description for that place, look up interesting places that are nearby, and save it all to the iOS storage for later.
